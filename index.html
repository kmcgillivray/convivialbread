      <h2 class="mt5">Real Bread</h2>

      <h3>Long, flavor-building fermentation</h3>
      <p>Each loaf of bread takes 18-24 hours to make from beginning to end.</p>

      <h3>Hand-crafted</h3>
      <p>No mixers, shapers, dividers, or machines of any kind are used on the dough.</p>

      <h3>No additives</h3>
      <p>Our dough is made with flour, water, salt, and natural wild yeast.</p>

      <h3>Wisconsin grains</h3>
      <p>We use 100% local, Wisconsin-grown organic or eco-friendly, chemical-free grain.</p>

      <h2 class="mt5">Creating Conviviality</h2>
      <blockquote>Conviviality is a friendly, lively atmosphere. The word comes from the Latin convivium, meaning "a feast", which comes from con- "with" + vivere "live".</blockquote>
      <p>An atmosphere of conviviality accompanied by local food is a key characteristic of both "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Zone">blue zones</a>", areas of the world with a high number of centenarians, and "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third places</a>", gathering places away from work and home that are essential to building strong, creative communities.</p>
